Hi! My name is Jordan Tseng.
This is my first AI project using NLTK module to recommend users resturant nearby Central University.
And u can also ask this chatbot "What is the weather today?", but i can't make sure it will tell u right. XD
There is one thing i can make sure that is it can help u make ur decision during breakfast time and lunch time.
There is some thing u need to do before u run this model.
1.run pip install numpy/run install pip nltk/run install pip torch.
2.go to nltk_utils.py and run it with third line which is "nltk.download('punkt')".
3.and go for train.py to train chatbot so it can tokensize words, using data u have saved in "intents.json" and feed them to model.
4.When u get all things ready, u can finally run chat.py. 
Hope it can help u making decision faster. Bye~
